error comes from when the command not found or command has missing arguments
stderr is error that comming after command was executed

exec: we use this when we want to execute commands that will not break the buffer
execFile: same as above but with exceuting a .sh file
spawn: this do not use the buffer, so we can make ei: "find /"
