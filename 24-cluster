with the cluster module we can check whether the process is a master process or child process.
if there is a master process, we begin to fork a new worker process and then we start to listening inside the worker process.
and the master process will not listening for any other request but only the worker processes will be listening on some port

all the workers and running on the same port

loadtest is for testing multiple request, apache brenchmark is similar to that

even if we have one cpu to run our nodejs app, we must to use cluster to avoid to crash down our service so our application should have zero downtime
